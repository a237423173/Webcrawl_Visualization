when I used 'request' to get some data, it was usually not useful for me without visualiztion.
Therefore, I used 'pandas' to clean data first, and then withdraled some columns that I wanted to compare.
After picking up selected data, I used 'subplot' to demonstrate the two kinds of values in the same xlabel('year').
Finally, I can observe the visualization of comparing with price and eps of TW-stock.
